How to handle local storage for each input

Scenario: walk the dog at 1pm becomes eat lunch at 1pm

1. have a global object that represents our Day planner timeslots
2. read that global object from localStorage when the page loads, use it to update
   our inputs
3. Any time one of our inputs changes...
    a. First, update the global object in our JS based on whatever input changed
    b. Then, make sure we update the localStorage version of that object 

What will the object actually look like?

var dayPlanner = {
    input1: "day planner description",
    input2: "another day planner description",
    input3: "walk dog"
}   

assuming that our inputs have the same id as our object property names:
<input id="input1"/>

we can create a click event such that when I click a "save" button, we can use the id of the 
corresponding input to index into the object:
$(".save").click(function(){
    //get the id from the correct input: (Hint: jQuery methods like "parent()" or "sibling())
    var inputElement = $(this).prev();
    //figure out the appropriate ID
    var inputId = inputElement.attr("id"); //"input1"

  1  //THIS IS THE MAGIC PART:
    dayPlanner[inputId] = inputElement.val();

    //then update local storage
})
