# Day Planner

## Description

This is a day planner created using JavaScript. This was a huge learning experience, and while there are still a few things I'm working out, it's generally how I envisioned it. I went into this knowing very little about APIs, localStorage, setting intervals, etc, and although I most definitely have a lot more to learn, I believe I now have a solid foundation to build upon.

## Installation

Clone to your local machine and open in your favorite code editor to check it out! Or visit the deployed version at: [Day Planner on GitHub Pages](https://alexgignilliat.github.io/Day-Planner/)

## Technologies Utilized

HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript, jQuery, Moment.js

## Information, Important Notes, etc

I started building this application at a time when I was just getting my feet wet with APIs and JavaScript in general. That being said, the end goal for this application is:

- Show an entire calendar and provide the user with the option to select a day to plan for
- Increase the responsiveness and overall aesthetic of the application. 
- Give user the ability to choose from several themes, day mode/night mode, etc.

â€œRemember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the Universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up."  - Stephen Hawking
